## 1. equivalent resistance calc

[![](/images/projects/resistance.PNG)](https://ect-assignment.netlify.app/)

A simple website that calculates the equivalent resistance between two nodes. My professor gave me this task to quickly verify students' assignment answers and spot copy-paste work.

## 2. text tidy

[![](/images/projects/textclean.PNG)](https://textclean.netlify.app/)

A minimal text-cleaning tool built to remove repeated or restricted lines from text. I built this to clean Coursera question prompts that explicitly instruct AI not to answer, so I could reframe them properly while using AI for learning and reference.
