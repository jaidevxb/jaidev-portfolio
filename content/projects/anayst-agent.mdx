## Description:
The MCP-Powered Data Analyst Agent is an autonomous, agentic AI system designed to perform intelligent, end-to-end data analysis on real-world datasets. Unlike traditional notebooks or dashboards, the agent reasons about the user’s question, decides what steps are necessary, and executes only the required analysis actions.

Built using a LangGraph state machine, the agent demonstrates true agentic behavior—planning, conditional execution, and grounded explanation—rather than static or prompt-only workflows.

## How it works:
1. User Input
    - User uploads a CSV or Excel dataset
    - Asks a natural-language analytical question

2. LLM Planning
    - An LLM generates a high-level analysis plan
    - Example: ```inspect → analyze → visualize → explain```

3. Intent-Aware Routing
    - LangGraph determines which steps to execute
    - Simple questions skip heavy analysis
    - Insight-driven questions trigger full analysis + visualization

4. Tool-Orchestrated Execution
    - Dataset inspection (schema, size, missing values)
    - Aggregations and computations using pandas
    - Visual insights generated with matplotlib

5. Grounded Explanation
    - Insights are explained strictly from computed results
    - No hallucination or speculative analysis
    - Explanations adapt to student or policymaker perspectives when relevant

## Why this project stands out:
- Implements true agentic decision-making, not static pipelines
- Avoids unnecessary computation through conditional execution
- Demonstrates planning, reasoning, and tool orchestration
- Works on real datasets, not toy examples
- Focuses on correctness, explainability, and practical analytics

## Tech Stack:
**Python** - core language    
**LangGraph** – agent state orchestration  
**LangChain** - tool abstraction, LLM integration, and prompt management  
**Google Gemini API** – planning and explanation  
**Pandas** – data analysis  
**Matplotlib** – visualization  
**Streamlit** – interactive UI  

## Project Status:
- Core agent complete and functional
- Supports inspection, analysis, visualization and explanation
- Designed as a flagship agentic AI + data analytics portfolio project
