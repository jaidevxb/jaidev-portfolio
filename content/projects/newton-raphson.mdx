This project is an interactive Newton–Raphson Method Visualizer built as part of a 4-week mentorship program under **Mr. Vivek Anandaraman Sir**. The goal was to transform a college-level Numerical Methods concept into a real, deployable web application while learning modern development and deployment tools.

The core application was scaffolded using Bolt, providing a React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS setup. On top of this, the project visualizes the Newton–Raphson root-finding process with real-time graphs, iteration tables, and clear explanations of each step.

Despite having only basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript at the start, this project helped bridge the gap into modern frameworks and cloud deployment. Major contributions included containerizing the application with Docker, pushing the image to Docker Hub, and deploying it on an AWS EC2 instance (currently not running).

## What it does
- Accepts a mathematical function and initial guess
- Iteratively computes roots using Newton–Raphson method
- Displays iteration-by-iteration results in a table
- Visualizes convergence through interactive graphs
- Explains the method in simple terms for beginners

## What I learned
- First implemented the Newton–Raphson method using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in Week 3
- Transformed the same logic into a modern web app in Week 4 using React and TypeScript
- Learned how vibe-coding platforms can scaffold complex projects efficiently
- Built and managed Docker images and containers, and pushed them to Docker Hub
- Deployed the application on an AWS EC2 instance (currently unavailable)
- Improved debugging, terminal usage, and Git/GitHub workflows

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- Algorithm: Newton–Raphson Method
- Containerization: Docker
- Deployment: AWS EC2 (currently unavailable)
- Version Control: Git & GitHub

This project marked a major milestone in moving from theory-based learning to real-world application development and cloud deployment.
