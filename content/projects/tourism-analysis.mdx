This project analyzes India’s tourism data from 2019 to 2023 to understand recovery patterns and shifting travel dynamics after the COVID-19 period. The study examines domestic tourism, foreign tourist arrivals, outbound travel by Indian nationals, and visitor demographics.

The analysis reveals strong post-pandemic recovery, with domestic tourism surpassing pre-2019 levels and inbound tourism steadily rebounding. These insights help highlight the role of domestic travel as the backbone of India’s tourism sector and provide valuable context for policy makers, businesses, and tourism stakeholders.
