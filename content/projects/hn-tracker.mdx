Hacker News Programming Tracker is a fully automated analytics project that monitors and visualizes daily programming activity on Hacker News. It fetches fresh posts every day, enriches them with analysis, and updates a live dashboard automatically.

Key capabilities:

- Fetches the latest ~1000 Hacker News stories daily using the Algolia API
- Classifies whether each post is programming-related and identifies the language mentioned
- Performs sentiment analysis on post titles to understand positive/negative discussions
- Stores cleaned, duplicate-free data in both CSV and SQLite formats
- Provides an interactive Streamlit dashboard with keyword search, date filters, language filters, and visual charts
- Automatically updates the dataset each morning using GitHub Actions
- Ensures continuous deployment — the Streamlit app refreshes whenever new data is committed
- This makes the project a complete mini data pipeline + dashboard system for tracking real-time tech and programming trends.
