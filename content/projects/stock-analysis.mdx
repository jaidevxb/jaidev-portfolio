This project analyzes 20MICRONS stock data using SQL as a hands-on way to practice and strengthen query-writing skills. A set of analytical questions are solved using SQL, and the results are displayed through an interactive web dashboard that shows both the query output and the corresponding SQL code.

The project focuses on applying core SQL concepts such as filtering, aggregations, grouping, sorting, and subqueries. In addition, the dashboard was built using AMP Code, making it a fun way to explore rapid UI generation alongside data querying. This helped reinforce both SQL fundamentals and lightweight frontend skills while keeping the learning process engaging.

Tech used: SQL, AMP Code, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
