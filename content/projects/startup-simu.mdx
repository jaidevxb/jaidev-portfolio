Startup Value Simulator is an interactive web app that helps founders and early employees model startup financing and exits with precision.

It lets you simulate real-world funding scenarios — from SAFEs to priced rounds — and clearly see how ownership, dilution, and returns change over time.

What it does
- Model SAFE notes (cap, discount, MFN)
- Simulate priced equity rounds
- Track founder dilution across multiple rounds
- Handle ESOP pool creation and top-ups (pre & post money)
- Model founder secondary sales
- Run exit simulations to calculate cash outcomes
- Maintain a transparent audit trail of every round

Why it’s useful
- Helps founders avoid cap table surprises
- Makes dilution and valuation math visual and intuitive
- Useful for learning, planning, and investor conversations
- Accurate financial engine with test-backed calculations

Tech highlights
- React + TypeScript frontend
- Pure, deterministic financial calculation engine
- State persistence with scenario sharing
- Fully tested cap table logic using Vitest

Example (SAFE → Priced Round)
```
const safe = {
  amount: 500_000,
  valuationCap: 5_000_000,
  discount: 0.2,
};

const pricedRound = {
  preMoney: 10_000_000,
  investment: 2_000_000,
};
```


The simulator automatically:
- Picks the better of cap vs discount
- Converts SAFEs into equity
- Issues new shares
- Recalculates ownership to 100%
- Shows founder, ESOP, and investor outcomes
