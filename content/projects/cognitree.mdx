## Description:
Cognitree is a web-based application that helps users explore complex topics visually. Each branch in the tree represents a unique piece of information retrieved using AI-powered search. Users actively grow, prune, and study branches to shape their learning path.

## What it does:
- Generates structured knowledge areas from a topic
- Expands branches using real-time AI-powered search
- Prevents duplicate information using negative prompting
- Allows pruning and repositioning of branches
- Creates flashcards from retrieved content
- Creates quiz for self assessment
- Ask doubts using an AI chatbot with branch-level context
- Saves and restores complete game sessions (Coming Soon)

## How it works (AI logic):

- Initial Knowledge Generation
```bash
POST /api/search
{
  "query": "machine learning"
}
```

- Gemini returns:
```bash
[
  "Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning",
  "Neural Networks",
  "Model Evaluation Metrics",
  "Overfitting and Regularization",
  "Real-world Applications"
]
```
These become the initial tree branches.

- Branch Growth with Non-Redundant Search
```bash
POST /api/web-search
{
  "query": "machine learning",
  "exclude": [
    "Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning",
    "Neural Networks"
  ]
}
```
The backend constructs:
```bash
"machine learning -supervised -neural networks"
```
Result:  
New, unseen information  
Attached to the selected branch  
No repeated content across sessions

- Flashcard Generation
```bash
POST /api/create-flashcards
{
  "nodeId": "branch_12",
  "content": "Regularization helps prevent overfitting..."
}
```
Gemini returns structured flashcards linked to that node.

- Quiz Generation
```bash
POST /api/create-quiz
{
  "nodeId": "branch_12",
  "content": "Regularization helps prevent overfitting..."
  "numQuestions": 5
}
```
Gemini generates structured quiz questions (MCQ) linked to the selected node for active recall and self-assessment.

- AI Chatbot (Doubt Clarification)
```bash
POST /api/chat
{
  "nodeId": "branch_12",
  "question": "Why does regularization reduce overfitting?"
}
```
Gemini returns a focused, context-aware explanation based on the existing tree knowledge.

This allows users to:  
Ask follow-up doubts while learning  
Get explanations without leaving the tree  
Keep answers aligned with their current learning path


## Play Guide (Quick):
1. Enter a topic to generate the initial knowledge tree
2. Grow branches to explore new information
3. Prune branches that aren’t useful
4. Create flashcards from branches for revision
5. Add flowers/fruits to mark progress
6. Generate quiz for active recall and self-assessment 
7. Ask doubts using the built-in AI chatbot
8. Save your tree and continue later (Coming Soon)

## Why it’s useful:

- Reduces information overload
- Ensures every expansion is unique
- Encourages structured exploration
- Combines discovery, clarification, and revision in one interface
- Useful for research, self-study, and concept mapping

## Tech Stack:
- Backend: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, SQLite
- Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas
- AI: Gemini Chat + Search APIs
- Persistence: Public game state storage (Coming Soon)
