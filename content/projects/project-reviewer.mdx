## Description:
The **Autonomous Project Reviewer Agent** is a compact, explainable agentic system designed to automatically review GitHub repositories and generate human-readable summaries, scores, and actionable recommendations. Unlike typical AI code reviewers that rely heavily on LLMs, this system prioritizes deterministic static analysis for correctness and uses LLMs only for high-level synthesis.

## What it does:
1. Safely clones a GitHub repository and enumerates files
2. Reads only whitelisted files with strict size and extension checks
3. Runs deterministic checks for:
    - Missing docstrings
    - TODO/FIXME markers
    - Oversized or poorly structured files
4. Scores the project across:
    - Code Quality
    - Documentation
    - Structure & Tests
5. Uses an LLM (Groq) to:
    - Summarize the project in plain English
    - Generate clear, actionable improvement suggestions
6. Outputs results via:
    - CLI
    - Streamlit UI
    - Exportable Markdown / PDF reports

## Why this project matters:
Most AI reviewers hallucinate or over-generalize. This project demonstrates a production-style agentic approach where:
- Core evaluation is deterministic and explainable
- LLMs are used only where they add value (synthesis, communication)
- Outputs are reliable, auditable, and resume-ready

## Design Philosophy:
- Deterministic logic > probabilistic guesses
- Explainability over black-box outputs
- Agentic systems that are:
    - Reliable
    - Practical
    - Reviewable
    - Real-world usable

## Tech Stack:
- **Language**: Python
- **UI**: Streamlit
- **LLM**: Groq API
- **Tooling**: GitPython, python-dotenv

## Project Status:
- Core system complete and functional
- CLI + UI supported
- Roadmap includes GitHub Actions and multi-repo benchmarking
